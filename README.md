## Introduction

`rise-data-twitter` is a Polymer 3 Web Component that provides tweets from a configurable Twitter account.

## Usage

The below illustrates simple usage of the component.

#### Example

```
  <rise-data-twitter
      id="rise-data-twitter-01" label="Twitter instance">
  </rise-data-twitter>
```

Since this is not a visual component, a listener needs to be registered to process the data it provides. You can check the available events in the [events section](#events)

### Attributes

This component receives the following list of attributes:

- **id**: (string): Unique HTMLElement id.
- **label**: (string): Assigns the label to use for the instance of the component in Template Editor.
- **non-editable**: ( empty / optional ): If present, it indicates this component is not available for customization in the Template Editor.
- **username**: ( string / optional ): The default username for which the tweets will be requested.
- **maxitems**: ( integer / optional ): The default number of tweets to request. Defaults to 25.

This component does not support PUD; it will need to be handled by Designers on a per Template basis.

### Events

_More events to be defined_

The component sends the following events:

- **configured**: The component has initialized what it requires to and is ready to handle a _start_ event.
- **data-update**: An event providing an object as described [here](#provided-data).
- **data-error**: An event indicating there is a configuration error.

The component listens for the following events:

- **start**: This event will cause the component to start generating events. It can be dispatched to the component when the _configured_ event has been fired.

### Provided data

The response includes an array of objects where each object contains the following fields:

- **name**: The title of the account, as indicated by its owner
- **screenName**: The account name/handle
- **profilePicture**: The url to the largest available version of the profile picture
- **text**: The full text of the tweet
- **createdAt**: The date when the tweet was created
- **images**: A list of urls with the largest image size available 
- **media**: A list of urls with media other than images (video and external links)
- **statistics**:
    - **retweetCount**: The number of retweets of the current tweet
    - **likeCount**: The number of likes to the current tweet
- **user**:
    - **description**: The description of the account, as indicated by its owner
    - **statuses**: The number of statuses/tweets of the account
    - **followers**: The number of followers of the account
- **quoted**: An object with the same structure as a tweet (name, screenName, etc, but not another quoted item). Only available if the main tweet is a quote to another tweet.

## Built With
- [Polymer 3](https://www.polymer-project.org/)
- [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/tools/tree/master/packages/cli)
- [WebComponents Polyfill](https://www.webcomponents.org/polyfills/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.org)

## Development

### Local Development Build
Clone this repo and change into this project directory.

Execute the following commands in Terminal:

```
npm install
npm install -g polymer-cli@1.9.7
npm run build
```

**Note**: If EPERM errors occur then install polymer-cli using the `--unsafe-perm` flag ( `npm install -g polymer-cli --unsafe-perm` ) and/or using sudo.

### Testing
You can run the suite of tests either by command terminal or interactive via Chrome browser.

#### Command Terminal
Execute the following command in Terminal to run tests:

```
npm run test
```

In case `polymer-cli` was installed globally, the `wct-istanbul` package will also need to be installed globally:

```
npm install -g wct-istanbul
```

#### Local Server
Run the following command in Terminal: `polymer serve`.

Now in your browser, navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8081/components/rise-data-twitter/demo/src/rise-data-twitter-dev.html
```

### Demo project

_More information to be provided_

A demo project showing how to implement a simple Twitter consumer can be found in the `demo` folder.

Another option is using `example-twitter-component` as the scaffolding for a new template. This project can be found in https://github.com/Rise-Vision/html-template-library

### Integration in a Template

_More information to be provided_

After creating the Template's structure in `html-template-library`, add a reference to the component in the `<head>` section of `template.html`:

```
<script src="https://widgets.risevision.com/stable/components/rise-data-twitter/1/rise-data-twitter.js"></script>
```

Add an instance of the component, as shown in the example:

```
  <rise-data-twitter
      id="rise-data-twitter-01" label="Twitter instance">
  </rise-data-twitter>
```

To test the template in a browser outside Player/Apps, add the following lines (replacing with the appropriate element id):

```
const riseDataTwitter01 = document.querySelector('#rise-data-twitter-01');

RisePlayerConfiguration.Helpers.sendStartEvent( riseDataTwitter01 );
```
